                  The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone
                  mafia family in New York. He is at the event of his daughter's
                  wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II
                  Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be
                  uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a
                  powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect
                  but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful
                  and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's
                  influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it.

                  Henry Hill might be a small time gangster, who may have taken
                  part in a robbery with Jimmy Conway and Tommy De Vito, two
                  other gangsters who might have set their sights a bit higher.
                  His two partners could kill off everyone else involved in the
                  robbery, and slowly start to think about climbing up through
                  the hierarchy of the Mob. Henry, however, might be badly
                  affected by his partners' success, but will he consider
                  stooping low enough to bring about the downfall of Jimmy and
                  Tommy?

                <h1>Shuter Island</h1>
                <p>
                  In 1954, up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned
                  to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's
                  Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital. He's been pushing for an
                  assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long
                  he thinks he's been brought there as part of a twisted plot by
                  hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical
                  to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating
                  skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses
                  him access to records he suspects would break the case wide
                  open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland,
                  more dangerous criminals "escape" in the confusion, and the
                  puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt
                  everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity

                  Earth's future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and
                  droughts. There is only one way to ensure mankind's survival:
                  Interstellar travel. A newly discovered wormhole in the far
                  reaches of our solar system allows a team of astronauts to go
                  where no man has gone before, a planet that may have the right
                  environment to sustain human life.
